# DiamondCutPredictor_Classifier

### Simple Diamond Cut Predictor (Classifier) using Various ML Algoritms

This notebook is a simple Classifier that will be used to predict the Cut of diamonds based on a variety of factors.

A few of the Algoritms used in this notebook are:
- XGBoost
- RandomForestClassifier
- K-NearestNeighbors
- Naive Bayes

Disclaimer: The dataset was found on Kaggle and does not belong to me. It can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds). This is one of my first DS projects, so I found and used many helpful guides to learn and structure my code/problem solving. The Kaggle guided notebook I found most helpful (and borrowed ideas from) is `lucidlenn's data analysis and classification using XGBoost` that uses classifiers to classify objects in space!
